% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% \section*{Accessibility}
% Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
% Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

% \section*{Software and Data}

% If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
% camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
% done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
% include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
% submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
% the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing
% system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
% when writing their review.

% % Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
% should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
% that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
% include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
% who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
% sponsors that provided financial support.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
% \nocite{langley00}

% \section{You \emph{can} have an appendix here.}

% You can have as much text here as you want. The main body must be at most $8$ pages long.
% For the final version, one more page can be added.
% If you want, you can use an appendix like this one.  

% The $\mathtt{\backslash onecolumn}$ command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column appendix, or can be removed if you prefer a two-column appendix.  Apart from this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering, etc.) should be kept the same as the main body.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
