\section{Conclusion}

In this position paper, we have argued that 
leveraging massive distributed edge devices can break barriers of data and computing wall, and everyone can participate in training large models with small edge devices.
Our comprehensive analysis demonstrated the vast untapped potential of edge resources, with smartphone data volume reaching approximately 33.1 EB and a combined computing power of around 9278 EFLOPS  in the past 5 years. 
These edge resources offer unique advantages in terms of data diversity, privacy, real-time context, and computing efficiency. 
% While significant challenges remain in managing heterogeneity and coordination across distributed systems, 
This paradigm shift towards distributed training could democratize AI development and open an exciting new chapter in the scaling of foundation models.
