## About The Project

<img src="images/screenshot.png" alt="Product Screenshot" width="800">

This project aims to explore and implement solutions for efficient deployment and operation of Large Language Models in edge computing environments. Through optimization of model architecture and distributed computing strategies, we strive to reduce computational resource requirements while maintaining model performance.

Key Features:
* Distributed LLM inference capabilities
* Edge device optimization
* Low-latency response mechanism
* Efficient resource utilization
* Flexible deployment options

### Built With

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
* [Ray](https://ray.io)
* [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai)
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io)

## Getting Started

Here's how to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* CUDA 11.7+ (optional, for GPU acceleration)
* Minimum 8GB RAM

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Distributed-LLM-Edges.git
   ```
2. Install required packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure environment variables
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with necessary environment variables
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the edge node server
   ```sh
   python edge_server.py
   ```
2. Run the inference client
   ```sh
   python inference_client.py
   ```

For more examples and documentation, please refer to the [Documentation](docs/).
